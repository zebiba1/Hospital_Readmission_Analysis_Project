# Hospital_Readmission_Analysis_Project

## üìä Overview
This project analyzes hospital readmission rates using CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) data. The analysis was conducted in BigQuery, and results were visualized in Power BI.

## üõ† Tools Used
- Google BigQuery (SQL)
- Power BI
- Excel

## üìà Key Insights
- The national average predicted readmission rate is approximately 15%.
- Certain states, such as DC and Kentucky, have higher average readmission rates.
- Top 5 facilities with the highest excess readmission ratios were identified.
- Trends over time were analyzed (though most data was for 2020).

## üóÇ Files Included
- `*.csv` files: Query outputs used in the Power BI dashboard.
- `dashboard_screenshot.png`: Visual preview.
- `Hospital_Readmission_Analysis.pdf`: Full exported report from Power BI.
